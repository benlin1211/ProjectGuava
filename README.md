# ProjectGuava
Ben Lin's NCTU CS project in 2020

# Introduction
This seminar applies Deep Clustering Network to classify the level of guava maturity.

# Dataset
THe Guava pictures are made by myself and filmed by WebCam. First, a guava is put on the table. Make sure that the direction of the pedicle and the ground surface are parallel.

Second, making the direction of the pedicle as axis, each guava is rotated with a small angle for 10 times. Each time the guava is rotated, a picture is taken.
