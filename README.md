Ben Lin's NCTU CS project in 2020

# Introduction
This seminar applies Deep Clustering Network to classify the level of guava maturity.

# Dataset
THe Guava pictures filmed by WebCam. First, we put the guava on the table, and make sure that the direction of the pedicle and the ground surface are parallel

Making the direction of the pedicle as axis, we rotate each guava with a small angle for 10 times. Each time the guava is rotated, a picture is taken.
